    "### What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted high level programming language.  It is often classified as a\n",
    "[\"scripting language\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) and\n",
    "is considered similar to languages such as Perl, Tcl, or Ruby.  The syntax\n",
    "of Python is loosely inspired by elements of C programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum around 1990 who named it in honor of Monty Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where to get Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Python.org](https://www.python.org/) is where you obtain Python.  For the purposes of this course, you\n",
    "only need a basic installation.  I recommend installing Python 3.6 or newer. Python 3.6 is used in the notes\n",
    "and solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why was Python created?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the words of Python's creator:\n",
    "\n",
    "> My original motivation for creating Python was the perceived need\n",
    "> for a higher level language in the Amoeba [Operating Systems]\n",
    "> project. I realized that the development of system administration\n",
    "> utilities in C was taking too long. Moreover, doing these things in\n",
    "> the Bourne shell wouldn't work for a variety of reasons. ... So,\n",
    "> there was a need for a language that would bridge the gap between C\n",
    "> and the shell.\n",

    "### Where is Python on my Machine?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are many environments in which you might run Python,\n",
    "Python is typically installed on your machine as a program that runs\n",
    "from the terminal or command shell. From the terminal, you should be\n",
    "able to type `python` like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "bash $ python\n",
    "Python 3.8.1 (default, Feb 20 2020, 09:29:22)\n",

    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    ">>> print(\"hello world\")\n",
    "hello world\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to using the shell or a terminal, you should probably\n",
    "stop, finish a short tutorial on that first, and then return here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are many non-shell environments where you can code\n",
    "Python, you will be a stronger Python programmer if you are able to\n",
    "run, debug, and interact with Python at the terminal.  This is\n",
    "Python's native environment.  If you are able to use Python here, you\n",
    "will be able to use it everywhere else.\n"
