    "\n",
    "This section discusses lists, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs often have to work with many objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A portfolio of stocks\n",
    "* A table of stock prices\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main choices to use.\n",

    "* Lists. Ordered data.\n",
    "* Dictionaries. Unordered data.\n",
    "* Sets. Unordered collection of unique items.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists as a Container\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a list when the order of the data matters. Remember that lists can hold any kind of object.\n",
    "For example, a list of tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "portfolio = [\n",
    "    ('GOOG', 100, 490.1),\n",
    "    ('IBM', 50, 91.3),\n",

    "portfolio[2]            # ('CAT', 150, 83.44)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### List construction\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a list from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "records = []  # Initial empty list\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use .append() to add more items\n",
    "records.append(('GOOG', 100, 490.10))\n",

    "        records.append((row[0], int(row[1]), float(row[2])))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dicts as a Container\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are useful if you want fast random lookups (by key name).  For\n",
    "example, a dictionary of stock prices:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prices = {\n",
    "   'GOOG': 513.25,\n",
    "   'CAT': 87.22,\n",
    "   'IBM': 93.37,\n",
    "   'MSFT': 44.12\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some simple lookups:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> prices['IBM']\n",
    "93.37\n",
    ">>> prices['GOOG']\n",
    "513.25\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dict Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of building a dict from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prices = {} # Initial empty dict\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert new items\n",
    "prices['GOOG'] = 513.25\n",
    "prices['CAT'] = 87.22\n",
    "prices['IBM'] = 93.37\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An example populating the dict from the contents of a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prices = {} # Initial empty dict\n",
    "\n",
    "with open('Data/prices.csv', 'rt') as f:\n",
    "    for line in f:\n",
    "        row = line.split(',')\n",
    "        prices[row[0]] = float(row[1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If you try this on the `Data/prices.csv` file, you'll find that\n",
    "it almost works--there's a blank line at the end that causes it to\n",
    "crash.  You'll need to figure out some way to modify the code to\n",
    "account for that (see Exercise 2.6).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionary Lookups\n",
    "\n",
    "You can test the existence of a key.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if key in d:\n",
    "    # YES\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # NO\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can look up a value that might not exist and provide a default value in case it doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = d.get(key, default)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> prices.get('IBM', 0.0)\n",
    "93.37\n",
    ">>> prices.get('SCOX', 0.0)\n",
    "0.0\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composite keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost any type of value can be used as a dictionary key in Python. A dictionary key must be of a type that is immutable.\n",
    "For example, tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "holidays = {\n",
    "  (1, 1) : 'New Years',\n",
    "  (3, 14) : 'Pi day',\n",
    "  (9, 13) : \"Programmer's day\",\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then to access:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> holidays[3, 14]\n",
    "'Pi day'\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Neither a list, a set, nor another dictionary can serve as a dictionary key, because lists and dictionaries are mutable.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are collection of unordered unique items.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tech_stocks = { 'IBM','AAPL','MSFT' }\n",
    "# Alternative syntax\n",
    "tech_stocks = set(['IBM', 'AAPL', 'MSFT'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are useful for membership tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> tech_stocks\n",
    "set(['AAPL', 'IBM', 'MSFT'])\n",
    ">>> 'IBM' in tech_stocks\n",
    "True\n",
    ">>> 'FB' in tech_stocks\n",
    "False\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are also useful for duplicate elimination.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "names = ['IBM', 'AAPL', 'GOOG', 'IBM', 'GOOG', 'YHOO']\n",
    "\n",
    "unique = set(names)\n",
    "# unique = set(['IBM', 'AAPL','GOOG','YHOO'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional set operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "unique.add('CAT')        # Add an item\n",
    "unique.remove('YHOO')    # Remove an item\n",

    "### Exercise 9.1: A list of tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `Data/portfolio.csv` contains a list of stocks in a\n",
    "portfolio.  In [Exercise 1.30](../01_Introduction/07_Functions.md), you\n",
    "wrote a function `portfolio_cost(filename)` that read this file and\n",
    "performed a simple calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code should have looked something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# pcost.py\n",
    "\n",
    "import csv\n",
    "\n",
    "def portfolio_cost(filename):\n",
    "    '''Computes the total cost (shares*price) of a portfolio file'''\n",
    "    total_cost = 0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "    with open(filename, 'rt') as f:\n",
    "        rows = csv.reader(f)\n",
    "        headers = next(rows)\n",
    "        for row in rows:\n",
    "            nshares = int(row[1])\n",
    "            price = float(row[2])\n",
    "            total_cost += nshares * price\n",
    "    return total_cost\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this code as a rough guide, create a new file `report.py`.  In\n",
    "that file, define a function `read_portfolio(filename)` that opens a\n",
    "given portfolio file and reads it into a list of tuples.  To do this,\n",
    "you’re going to make a few minor modifications to the above code.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, instead of defining `total_cost = 0`, you’ll make a variable\n",
    "that’s initially set to an empty list. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "portfolio = []\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, instead of totaling up the cost, you’ll turn each row into a\n",
    "tuple exactly as you just did in the last exercise and append it to\n",
    "this list. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for row in rows:\n",
    "    holding = (row[0], int(row[1]), float(row[2]))\n",
    "    portfolio.append(holding)\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Experiment with your function interactively (just a reminder that in\n",

    "interpreter):\n",

    "*Hint: Use `-i` when executing the file in the terminal*\n",
    "\n",
