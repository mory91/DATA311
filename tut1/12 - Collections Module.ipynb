    "# collections module\n",
    "\n",
    "The `collections` module provides a number of useful objects for data handling.\n",
    "This part briefly introduces some of these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Counting Things\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you want to tabulate the total shares of each stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "portfolio = [\n",
    "    ('GOOG', 100, 490.1),\n",
    "    ('IBM', 50, 91.1),\n",
    "    ('CAT', 150, 83.44),\n",
    "    ('IBM', 100, 45.23),\n",
    "    ('GOOG', 75, 572.45),\n",
    "    ('AA', 50, 23.15)\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two `IBM` entries and two `GOOG` entries in this list. The shares need to be combined together somehow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Counters\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Use a `Counter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import Counter\n",
    "total_shares = Counter()\n",
    "for name, shares, price in portfolio:\n",
    "    total_shares[name] += shares\n",
    "\n",
    "total_shares['IBM']     # 150\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: One-Many Mappings\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: You want to map a key to multiple values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "portfolio = [\n",
    "    ('GOOG', 100, 490.1),\n",
    "    ('IBM', 50, 91.1),\n",
    "    ('CAT', 150, 83.44),\n",
    "    ('IBM', 100, 45.23),\n",
    "    ('GOOG', 75, 572.45),\n",
    "    ('AA', 50, 23.15)\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Like in the previous example, the key `IBM` should have two different tuples instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Use a `defaultdict`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import defaultdict\n",
    "holdings = defaultdict(list)\n",
    "for name, shares, price in portfolio:\n",
    "    holdings[name].append((shares, price))\n",
    "holdings['IBM'] # [ (50, 91.1), (100, 45.23) ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `defaultdict` ensures that every time you access a key you get a default value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Keeping a History\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: We want a history of the last N things.\n",
    "Solution: Use a `deque`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from collections import deque\n",
    "\n",
    "history = deque(maxlen=N)\n",
    "with open(filename) as f:\n",
    "    for line in f:\n",
    "        history.append(line)\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "```\n"

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "The `collections` module might be one of the most useful library\n",
    "modules for dealing with special purpose kinds of data handling\n",
    "problems such as tabulating and indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we’ll look at a few simple examples.  Start by\n",
    "running your `report.py` program so that you have the portfolio of\n",
    "stocks loaded in the interactive mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "bash % python3 -i report.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 12.1: Tabulating with Counters\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you wanted to tabulate the total number of shares of each stock.\n",
    "This is easy using `Counter` objects. Try it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> portfolio = read_portfolio('Data/portfolio.csv')\n",
    ">>> from collections import Counter\n",
    ">>> holdings = Counter()\n",
    ">>> for s in portfolio:\n",
    "        holdings[s['name']] += s['shares']\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> holdings\n",
    "Counter({'MSFT': 250, 'IBM': 150, 'CAT': 150, 'AA': 100, 'GE': 95})\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Carefully observe how the multiple entries for `MSFT` and `IBM` in `portfolio` get combined into a single entry here.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a Counter just like a dictionary to retrieve individual values:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> holdings['IBM']\n",
    "150\n",
    ">>> holdings['MSFT']\n",
    "250\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to rank the values, do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> # Get three most held stocks\n",
    ">>> holdings.most_common(3)\n",
    "[('MSFT', 250), ('IBM', 150), ('CAT', 150)]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s grab another portfolio of stocks and make a new Counter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> portfolio2 = read_portfolio('Data/portfolio2.csv')\n",
    ">>> holdings2 = Counter()\n",
    ">>> for s in portfolio2:\n",
    "          holdings2[s['name']] += s['shares']\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> holdings2\n",
    "Counter({'HPQ': 250, 'GE': 125, 'AA': 50, 'MSFT': 25})\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let’s combine all of the holdings doing one simple operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> holdings\n",
    "Counter({'MSFT': 250, 'IBM': 150, 'CAT': 150, 'AA': 100, 'GE': 95})\n",
    ">>> holdings2\n",
    "Counter({'HPQ': 250, 'GE': 125, 'AA': 50, 'MSFT': 25})\n",
    ">>> combined = holdings + holdings2\n",
    ">>> combined\n",
    "Counter({'MSFT': 275, 'HPQ': 250, 'GE': 220, 'AA': 150, 'IBM': 150, 'CAT': 150})\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is only a small taste of what counters provide. However, if you\n",
    "ever find yourself needing to tabulate values, you should consider\n",
    "using one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commentary: collections module\n",
    "\n",
    "The `collections` module is one of the most useful library modules\n",
    "in all of Python.  In fact, we could do an extended tutorial on just\n",
    "that.  However, doing so now would also be a distraction.  For now,\n",
    "put `collections` on your list of bedtime reading for later."
