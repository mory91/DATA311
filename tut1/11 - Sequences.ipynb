    "# 2.4 Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequence Datatypes\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has three *sequence* datatypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* String: `'Hello'`. A string is a sequence of characters.\n",
    "* List: `[1, 4, 5]`.\n",
    "* Tuple: `('GOOG', 100, 490.1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "All sequences are ordered, indexed by integers, and have a length.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 'Hello'               # String\n",
    "b = [1, 4, 5]             # List\n",
    "c = ('GOOG', 100, 490.1)  # Tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "# Indexed order\n",
    "a[0]                      # 'H'\n",
    "b[-1]                     # 5\n",
    "c[1]                      # 100\n",
    "\n",
    "# Length of sequence\n",
    "len(a)                    # 5\n",
    "len(b)                    # 3\n",
    "len(c)                    # 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequences can be replicated: `s * n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = 'Hello'\n",
    ">>> a * 3\n",
    "'HelloHelloHello'\n",
    ">>> b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    ">>> b * 2\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequences of the same type can be concatenated: `s + t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    ">>> b = (4, 5)\n",
    ">>> a + b\n",
    "(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    ">>>\n",
    ">>> c = [1, 5]\n",
    ">>> a + c\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "TypeError: can only concatenate tuple (not \"list\") to tuple\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing means to take a subsequence from a sequence.\n",
    "The syntax is `s[start:end]`. Where `start` and `end` are the indexes of the subsequence you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]\n",
    "\n",
    "a[2:5]    # [2,3,4]\n",
    "a[-5:]    # [4,5,6,7,8]\n",
    "a[:3]     # [0,1,2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Indices `start` and `end` must be integers.\n",
    "* Slices do *not* include the end value. It is like a half-open interval from math.\n",
    "* If indices are omitted, they default to the beginning or end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slice re-assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "On lists, slices can be reassigned and deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Reassignment\n",
    "a = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]\n",
    "a[2:4] = [10,11,12]       # [0,1,10,11,12,4,5,6,7,8]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: The reassigned slice doesn't need to have the same length.*\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Deletion\n",
    "a = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]\n",
    "del a[2:4]                # [0,1,4,5,6,7,8]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequence Reductions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some common functions to reduce a sequence to a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> s = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    ">>> sum(s)\n",
    "10\n",
    ">>> min(s)\n",
    "1\n",
    ">>> max(s)\n",
    "4\n",
    ">>> t = ['Hello', 'World']\n",
    ">>> max(t)\n",
    "'World'\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iteration over a sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "The for-loop iterates over the elements in a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> s = [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    ">>> for i in s:\n",
    "...     print(i)\n",
    "...\n",
    "1\n",
    "4\n",
    "9\n",
    "16\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On each iteration of the loop, you get a new item to work with.\n",
    "This new value is placed into the iteration variable. In this example, the\n",
    "iteration variable is `x`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for x in s:         # `x` is an iteration variable\n",
    "    ...statements\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "On each iteration, the previous value of the iteration variable is overwritten (if any).\n",
    "After the loop finishes, the variable retains the last value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### break statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `break` statement to break out of a loop early.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for name in namelist:\n",
    "    if name == 'Jake':\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "statements\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the `break` statement executes, it exits the loop and moves\n",
    "on the next `statements`.  The `break` statement only applies to the\n",
    "inner-most loop. If this loop is within another loop, it will not\n",
    "break the outer loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### continue statement\n",
    "\n",
    "To skip one element and move to the next one, use the `continue` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for line in lines:\n",
    "    if line == '\\n':    # Skip blank lines\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    # More statements\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful when the current item is not of interest or needs to be ignored in the processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looping over integers\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to count, use `range()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(100):\n",
    "    # i = 0,1,...,99\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is `range([start,] end [,step])`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(100):\n",
    "    # i = 0,1,...,99\n",
    "for j in range(10,20):\n",
    "    # j = 10,11,..., 19\n",
    "for k in range(10,50,2):\n",
    "    # k = 10,12,...,48\n",
    "    # Notice how it counts in steps of 2, not 1.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ending value is never included. It mirrors the behavior of slices.\n",
    "* `start` is optional. Default `0`.\n",
    "* `step` is optional. Default `1`.\n",
    "* `range()` computes values as needed. It does not actually store a large range of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### enumerate() function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `enumerate` function adds an extra counter value to iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "names = ['Elwood', 'Jake', 'Curtis']\n",
    "for i, name in enumerate(names):\n",
    "    # Loops with i = 0, name = 'Elwood'\n",
    "    # i = 1, name = 'Jake'\n",
    "    # i = 2, name = 'Curtis'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form is `enumerate(sequence [, start = 0])`. `start` is optional.\n",
    "A good example of using `enumerate()` is tracking line numbers while reading a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(filename) as f:\n",
    "    for lineno, line in enumerate(f, start=1):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, `enumerate` is just a nice shortcut for:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "for x in s:\n",
    "    statements\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `enumerate` is less typing and runs slightly faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For and tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "You can iterate with multiple iteration variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "points = [\n",
    "  (1, 4),(10, 40),(23, 14),(5, 6),(7, 8)\n",
    "]\n",
    "for x, y in points:\n",
    "    # Loops with x = 1, y = 4\n",
    "    #            x = 10, y = 40\n",
    "    #            x = 23, y = 14\n",
    "    #            ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When using multiple variables, each tuple is *unpacked* into a set of iteration variables.\n",
    "The number of variables must match the number of items in each tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "### zip() function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `zip` function takes multiple sequences and makes an iterator that combines them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "columns = ['name', 'shares', 'price']\n",
    "values = ['GOOG', 100, 490.1 ]\n",
    "pairs = zip(columns, values)\n",
    "# ('name','GOOG'), ('shares',100), ('price',490.1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the result you must iterate. You can use multiple variables to unpack the tuples as shown earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for column, value in pairs:\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A common use of `zip` is to create key/value pairs for constructing dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "d = dict(zip(columns, values))\n",

    "### Exercise 11.5: Inverting a dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary maps keys to values. For example, a dictionary of stock prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> prices = {\n",
    "        'GOOG' : 490.1,\n",
    "        'AA' : 23.45,\n",
    "        'IBM' : 91.1,\n",
    "        'MSFT' : 34.23\n",
    "    }\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use the `items()` method, you can get `(key,value)` pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> prices.items()\n",
    "dict_items([('GOOG', 490.1), ('AA', 23.45), ('IBM', 91.1), ('MSFT', 34.23)])\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what if you wanted to get a list of `(value, key)` pairs instead?\n",
    "*Hint: use `zip()`.*\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> pricelist = list(zip(prices.values(),prices.keys()))\n",
    ">>> pricelist\n",
    "[(490.1, 'GOOG'), (23.45, 'AA'), (91.1, 'IBM'), (34.23, 'MSFT')]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you do this? For one, it allows you to perform certain kinds\n",
    "of data processing on the dictionary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> min(pricelist)\n",
    "(23.45, 'AA')\n",
    ">>> max(pricelist)\n",
    "(490.1, 'GOOG')\n",
    ">>> sorted(pricelist)\n",
    "[(23.45, 'AA'), (34.23, 'MSFT'), (91.1, 'IBM'), (490.1, 'GOOG')]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This also illustrates an important feature of tuples. When used in\n",
    "comparisons, tuples are compared element-by-element starting with the\n",
    "first item. Similar to how strings are compared\n",
    "character-by-character.\n",
    "\n",
    "`zip()` is often used in situations like this where you need to pair\n",
    "up data from different places.  For example, pairing up the column\n",
    "names with column values in order to make a dictionary of named\n",
    "values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `zip()` is not limited to pairs. For example, you can use it\n",
    "with any number of input lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    ">>> b = ['w', 'x', 'y', 'z']\n",
    ">>> c = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8]\n",
    ">>> list(zip(a, b, c))\n",
    "[(1, 'w', 0.2), (2, 'x', 0.4), (3, 'y', 0.6), (4, 'z', 0.8))]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, be aware that `zip()` stops once the shortest input sequence is exhausted.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    ">>> b = ['x', 'y', 'z']\n",
    ">>> list(zip(a,b))\n",
    "[(1, 'x'), (2, 'y'), (3, 'z')]\n",
