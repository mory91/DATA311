    "### Types of Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has 4 types of numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Booleans\n",
    "* Integers\n",
    "* Floating point\n",
    "* Complex (imaginary numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Booleans (bool)\n",
    "\n",
    "Booleans have two values: `True`, `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = True\n",
    "b = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerically, they're evaluated as integers with value `1`, `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "c = 4 + True # 5\n",
    "d = False\n",
    "if d == 0:\n",
    "    print('d is False')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*But, don't write code like that. It would be odd.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integers (int)\n",
    "\n",
    "Signed values of arbitrary size and base:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 37\n",

    "abs(x)     Absolute value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Floating point (float)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use a decimal or exponential notation to specify a floating point value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 37.45\n",
    "b = 4e5 # 4 x 10**5 or 400,000\n",
    "c = -1.345e-10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Floats are represented as double precision using the native CPU representation [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754).\n",
    "This is the same as the `double` type in the programming language C.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 17 digits of precision  \n",
    "> Exponent from -308 to 308\n",
    "\n",
    "Be aware that floating point numbers are inexact when representing decimals.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = 2.1 + 4.2\n",
    ">>> a == 6.3\n",
    "False\n",
    ">>> a\n",
    "6.300000000000001\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **not a Python issue**, but the underlying floating point hardware on the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x + y      Add\n",

    "x % y      Modulo\n",
    "x ** y     Power\n",
    "abs(x)     Absolute Value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the same operators as Integers, except for the bit-wise operators.\n",
    "Additional math functions are found in the `math` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",

    "\n",
    "### Comparisons\n",
    "\n",
    "The following comparison / relational operators work with numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "x < y      Less than\n",
    "x <= y     Less than or equal\n",
    "x > y      Greater than\n",
    "x >= y     Greater than or equal\n",
    "x == y     Equal to\n",
    "x != y     Not equal to\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can form more complex boolean expressions using\n",
    "\n",
    "`and`, `or`, `not`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if b >= a and b <= c:\n",
    "    print('b is between a and c')\n",
    "\n",
    "if not (b < a or b > c):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Converting Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "The type name can be used to convert values:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = int(x)    # Convert x to integer\n",
    "b = float(x)  # Convert x to float\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Try it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = 3.14159\n",
    ">>> int(a)\n",
    "3\n",
    ">>> b = '3.14159' # It also works with strings containing numbers\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
