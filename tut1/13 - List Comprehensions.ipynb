    "# List Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "A common task is processing items in a list.  This section introduces list comprehensions,\n",
    "a powerful tool for doing just that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating new lists\n",
    "\n",
    "A list comprehension creates a new list by applying an operation to\n",
    "each element of a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    ">>> b = [2*x for x in a ]\n",
    ">>> b\n",
    "[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> names = ['Elwood', 'Jake']\n",
    ">>> a = [name.lower() for name in names]\n",
    ">>> a\n",
    "['elwood', 'jake']\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The general syntax is: `[ <expression> for <variable_name> in <sequence> ]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also filter during the list comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = [1, -5, 4, 2, -2, 10]\n",
    ">>> b = [2*x for x in a if x > 0 ]\n",
    ">>> b\n",
    "[2, 8, 4, 20]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions are hugely useful.  For example, you can collect values of a specific\n",
    "dictionary fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "stocknames = [s['name'] for s in stocks]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can perform database-like queries on sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = [s for s in stocks if s['price'] > 100 and s['shares'] > 50 ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also combine a list comprehension with a sequence reduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "cost = sum([s['shares']*s['price'] for s in stocks])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```code\n",
    "[ <expression> for <variable_name> in <sequence> if <condition>]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What it means:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = []\n",
    "for variable_name in sequence:\n",
    "    if condition:\n",
    "        result.append(expression)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical Digression\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions come from math (set-builder notation).\n",
    "\n",
    "```code\n",
    "a = [ x * x for x in s if x > 0 ] # Python\n",
    "\n",
    "a = { x^2 | x ∈ s, x > 0 }         # Math\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also implemented in several other languages. Most\n",
    "coders probably aren't thinking about their math class though. So,\n",
    "it's fine to view it as a cool list shortcut.\n",
    "\n",

    "List comprehensions are commonly used in Python as an efficient means\n",

    "simple as possible.  It’s okay to break things into multiple\n",
    "steps. For example, it’s not clear that you would want to spring that\n",
    "last example on your unsuspecting co-workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, knowing how to quickly manipulate data is a skill that’s\n",
    "incredibly useful.  There are numerous situations where you might have\n",
    "to solve some kind of one-off problem involving data imports, exports,\n",
    "extraction, and so forth.  Becoming a guru master of list\n",
    "comprehensions can substantially reduce the time spent devising a\n",
