    "# 2.1 Datatypes and Data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "This section introduces data structures in the form of tuples and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primitive Datatypes\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a few primitive types of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Integers\n",
    "* Floating point numbers\n",
    "* Strings (text)\n",
    "\n",
    "We learned about these in the introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### None type\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "email_address = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`None` is often used as a placeholder for optional or missing value.  It\n",
    "evaluates as `False` in conditionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if email_address:\n",
    "    send_email(email_address, msg)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Real programs have more complex data. For example information about a stock holding:\n",
    "\n",
    "```code\n",
    "100 shares of GOOG at $490.10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an \"object\" with three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Name or symbol of the stock (\"GOOG\", a string)\n",
    "* Number of shares (100, an integer)\n",
    "* Price (490.10 a float)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "A tuple is a collection of values grouped together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = ('GOOG', 100, 490.1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the `()` are omitted in the syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = 'GOOG', 100, 490.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Special cases (0-tuple, 1-tuple).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "t = ()            # An empty tuple\n",
    "w = ('GOOG', )    # A 1-item tuple\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are often used to represent *simple* records or structures.\n",
    "Typically, it is a single *object* of multiple parts. A good analogy: *A tuple is like a single row in a database table.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple contents are ordered (like an array).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = ('GOOG', 100, 490.1)\n",
    "name = s[0]                 # 'GOOG'\n",
    "shares = s[1]               # 100\n",
    "price = s[2]                # 490.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the contents can't be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> s[1] = 75\n",
    "TypeError: object does not support item assignment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can, however, make a new tuple based on a current tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = (s[0], 75, s[2])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuple Packing\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are more about packing related items together into a single *entity*.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = ('GOOG', 100, 490.1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The tuple is then easy to pass around to other parts of a program as a single object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuple Unpacking\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the tuple elsewhere, you can unpack its parts into variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name, shares, price = s\n",
    "print('Cost', shares * price)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of variables on the left must match the tuple structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name, shares = s     # ERROR\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "...\n",
    "ValueError: too many values to unpack\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuples vs. Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples look like read-only lists. However, tuples are most often used\n",
    "for a *single item* consisting of multiple parts.  Lists are usually a\n",
    "collection of distinct items, usually all of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "record = ('GOOG', 100, 490.1)       # A tuple representing a record in a portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "symbols = [ 'GOOG', 'AAPL', 'IBM' ]  # A List representing three stock symbols\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary is mapping of keys to values.  It's also sometimes called a hash table or\n",
    "associative array.  The keys serve as indices for accessing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = {\n",
    "    'name': 'GOOG',\n",
    "    'shares': 100,\n",
    "    'price': 490.1\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common operations\n",
    "\n",
    "To get values from a dictionary use the key names.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print(s['name'], s['shares'])\n",
    "GOOG 100\n",
    ">>> s['price']\n",
    "490.10\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To add or modify values assign using the key names.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> s['shares'] = 75\n",
    ">>> s['date'] = '6/6/2007'\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To delete a value use the `del` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> del s['date']\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why dictionaries?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are useful when there are *many* different values and those values\n",
    "might be modified or manipulated.  Dictionaries make your code more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s['price']\n",
    "# vs\n",
    "s[2]\n",
    "```"

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last few exercises, you wrote a program that read a datafile\n",
    "`Data/portfolio.csv`. Using the `csv` module, it is easy to read the\n",
    "file row-by-row.\n",

    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Although reading the file is easy, you often want to do more with the\n",
    "data than read it.  For instance, perhaps you want to store it and\n",
    "start performing some calculations on it.  Unfortunately, a raw \"row\"\n",
    "of data doesn’t give you enough to work with. For example, even a\n",
    "simple math calculation doesn’t work:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "and turn it into a more useful kind of object so that you can work\n",
    "with it later.  Two simple options are tuples or dictionaries.\n",
